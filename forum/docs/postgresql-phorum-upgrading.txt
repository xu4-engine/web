Important notes for upgrading Phorum for Postgresql users
- v0.1 (tomaz@phorum.org)

Before Phorum 3.4.2 table definitions for bodies table lacked primary key (also unique index)
which can cause MAJOR slowdown and intense overload (load would went into the sky!) with
lots of concurrent users. This happens because Postgresql has to do sequence scan of bodies
table to find matching bodies which can be slow with over 100 000 messages per forum. This
should be ideally fixed in upgrade script, but because of possible duplicates sometimes
creating unique index fails so it has to be created manually AFTER deleting duplicate records.

You can try creating unique index first to see if you have this problem:
(if your forum table name is forum1)

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX forum1_bodiespri_key ON forum1_bodies(id);

If it fails you will have to find duplicate IDs and delete them before trying to create index
again.

This has to be repeated for ALL forums.
