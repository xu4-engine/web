Quick and dirty guide to our Website
====================================

Overview
--------

Most of the site is in the "web" Git repository, but a separate download
directory is used on the web server for files that are large or change
frequently.

The site HTML is built using a code generator (a small Boron script).
A Makefile is used for updates, with transfers done via rsync.


Initial Setup
-------------

 - Export the environment variable "SF_USER" with your SourceForge user name.

 - Checkout the web repository:

       git clone ssh://${SF_USER}@git.code.sf.net/p/xu4/web

 - Run "make fetch_dl" to get a local copy of the download directory.


Modifying the Site
------------------

 - Change files in the page-spec/, css/, images/ & download/ directories as
   desired.

 - Run "make" to generate a local copy of the HTML files.  These may be
   inspected in a web browser before updating the site.

 - Use "make update" to upload the changed files to the web server

 - Commit and push both the page-spec/ source files and the generated output
   to Git.  The outputs are kept in the repository so that:

     1. Page changes can be checked using "git diff".
     2. Replacing the generator script (or returning to manual edits) could
        be more easily done.


Removing Files
--------------

To remove files from the server use an rsync command with the "--delete"
option or login to the web server.

To login create an interactive shell session
(see http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Shell%20service):

    ssh -t ${SF_USER},xu4@shell.sourceforge.net create
    cd /home/project-web/xu4/htdocs
